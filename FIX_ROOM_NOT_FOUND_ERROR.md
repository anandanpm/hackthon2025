## Detailed Debugging

### Check 1: Verify Channels Exist

#### In Rocket.Chat:
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login
3. Check sidebar - do you see any channels?
4. If NO channels → Create one!
5. If YES channels → Make sure you're a member

### Check 2: Check Browser Console

#### Open DevTools (F12):
1. Go to **"Console"** tab
2. Look for errors like:
   ```
   [error-room-not-found]
   Failed to load rooms
   No rooms available
   ```
3. This tells you what's failing

### Check 3: Check Network Tab

#### In DevTools:
1. Go to **"Network"** tab
2. Refresh page
3. Look for API calls:
   ```
   /api/v1/rooms.get
   /api/v1/channels.list
   ```
4. Click on them to see response
5. Check if rooms are returned

---

## Prevention

### Always Have Default Channels

Create these channels when setting up:

```
1. #general - General discussion
2. #random - Random chat
3. #support - Help and support
```

### Auto-Join New Users

In Rocket.Chat admin:
1. Go to **Administration**
2. Go to **Settings** → **Accounts**
3. Enable **"Auto-join channels"**
4. Add: `general,random`
5. New users auto-join these channels!

## Code-Level Fix

If you want to handle this error gracefully in code:

### Update ChatLayout.jsx

```jsx
const loadRooms = async () => {
  if (!authToken || !userId) return;
  
  try {
    const result = await getRooms(authToken, userId);
    if (result.success) {
      if (result.rooms && result.rooms.length > 0) {
        setRooms(result.rooms);
        setCurrentRoom(result.rooms[0]);
      } else {
        // No rooms available
        setError('No channels available. Please create or join a channel in Rocket.Chat.');
        setRooms([]);
        setCurrentRoom(null);
      }
    } else {
      setError(result.error || 'Failed to load channels');
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error loading rooms:', err);
    setError('Unable to load channels. Please check your connection.');
  }
};
```

### Add Error Display

```jsx
{error && (
  <div className="error-banner">
    <p>{error}</p>
    <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Open Rocket.Chat to create channels
    </a>
  </div>
