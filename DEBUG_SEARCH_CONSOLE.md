## What You'll See in Console

### Complete Log Flow:

```
=== SEARCH START ===
Search query: hello
Auth token: Present
User ID: abc123xyz

Calling searchMessages API...

[rocketchat] Search response: {
  success: true,
  result: {
    messages: [...],
    rooms: [...],
    users: [...]
  }
}

[rocketchat] Enriched messages: [
  {
    _id: "msg1",
    msg: "hello world",
    rid: "room123",
    roomName: "general",  ← Check if this exists!
    u: { name: "John" }
  }
]

=== SEARCH RESULT FROM BACKEND ===
Success: true
Total results: 5
Messages array: Array(5) [...]
Full result object: {
  success: true,
  messages: [...],
  total: 5,
  count: 5
}

✅ Search successful!
Number of messages: 5
First message sample: {
  _id: "msg1",
  msg: "hello world",
  rid: "room123",
  roomName: "general",  ← Check this!
  u: { name: "John" }
}
Message has roomName? true  ← Should be true!

=== SEARCH END ===
```

## Key Things to Check

### 1. Is Backend Responding?
```
Look for:
[rocketchat] Search response: {...}

✅ If you see this → Backend is responding
❌ If you don't see this → Backend not responding
```

### 2. Are Messages Coming?
```
Look for:
Messages array: Array(5) [...]

✅ If Array(5) → 5 messages found
❌ If Array(0) → No messages found
```

### 3. Do Messages Have Room Names?
```
Look for:
Message has roomName? true

✅ If true → Room names are present
❌ If false → Room names missing
```

### 4. What's the Room Name?
```
Look for:
roomName: "general"

✅ If "general" → Correct channel name
❌ If "Unknown" → Room name not enriched
❌ If undefined → Room name missing
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue 1: No Console Logs at All
```
Problem: Nothing appears in console

Check:
1. Is Console tab open?
2. Did you click Search button?
3. Is page frozen/crashed?

Solution:
- Refresh page (F5)
- Try again
```

### Issue 2: "Auth token: Missing"
```
Problem: Auth token not present

Check:
1. Are you logged in?
2. Did login succeed?

Solution:
- Logout and login again
- Check login credentials
```

### Issue 3: "Success: false"
```
Problem: API call failed

Check console for:
❌ Search failed: [error message]

Common errors:
- "Invalid token" → Login again
- "Network error" → Check Rocket.Chat server
- "400 Bad Request" → API issue
```

### Issue 4: "Messages array: Array(0)"
```
Problem: No results found

This is NORMAL if:
- No messages match search query
- Channels are empty
- Search term doesn't exist

Try:
- Search for common words like "hello"
- Check if messages exist in channels
```

### Issue 5: "Message has roomName? false"
```
Problem: Room names not being added

Check:
[rocketchat] Search response: {...}

Look for:
result.rooms: [...]

If rooms array is empty:
- Spotlight API not returning room info
- Need to use different API endpoint
```
