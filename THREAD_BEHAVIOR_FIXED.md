# Thread Behavior - Fixed! ✅

## Problem Solved

**Before:** Users could create threads on their own messages (weird!)  
**After:** Thread button only shows on other people's messages

---

## What Changed

### Message.jsx - Smart Thread Button Logic

```jsx
// Check if current user is the message author
const isMessageAuthor = message.u?._id === userId;

// Only show thread button if:
// 1. Not your own message (prevent self-threading)
// 2. OR thread already exists (can view existing thread)
{(!isMessageAuthor || threadCount > 0) && (
  <button
    className="message-thread-btn"
    title={threadCount > 0 ? "View thread" : "Reply in thread"}
    onClick={handleStartThread}
  >
    💬
  </button>
)}
```

## How It Works Now

### ❌ Your Own Message (No Thread)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ You              2:30 PM        │
│ Hello everyone!                 │
│                        [📌]     │ ← No thread button
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Why?** You can't reply to yourself. That's weird!

### ✅ Other's Message (No Thread)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ John             2:31 PM        │
│ What's the deadline?            │
│                   [📌] [💬]     │ ← Thread button visible
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Why?** You can reply to John's message in a thread.

### ✅ Your Message (With Thread)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ You              2:30 PM        │
│ Hello everyone!                 │
│ 💬 3 replies                    │
│                   [📌] [💬]     │ ← Can view thread
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```
**Why?** Thread exists, so you can view it!
